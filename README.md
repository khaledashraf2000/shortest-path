# Shortest Path Problem using DFS

This is my first graph problem that I've solved, it actually took me 3 days to get everything right, I can surely say I'm proud of it.

[This](http://codeforces.com/contest/242/problem/C) is the original problem. 

The code is well documented and every approach I took to optimize space is discussed in the comments.
